Introduction: ggplot2, D3.

Related work: lots of other R packages and Vega for D3.

Table 1: a comparison of related packages, full table here
https://github.com/tdhock/animint/blob/master/etc/references.org
but we should probably only show something like this reduced table
https://github.com/tdhock/interactive-tutorial/tree/master/animation.

Figure 1: the familiar GapMinder data viz. 2 different frames of the animation, with 2 different countries selected.

Figure 2: schematic diagram of how the package works: R code makes JS/CSV/HTML etc.
